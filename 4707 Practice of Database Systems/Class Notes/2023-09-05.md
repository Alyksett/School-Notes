DBMS: Database Management System

__Users of a DBMS__:
(Ranked in order of complexity)
- Casual users 
- SQL Writers - 2-3 weeks of classtime
- DB Designers - 1-2 weeks of classtime
- DB Admins
- DB Developers - Rest

DBMS takes SQL queries, puts into...
- Query Parser
- Query Optimizer
    - How do we execute this query? 
        - SQL state: Relational Algebra
- Query Executor
- Memory Buffer Pool
    - Gets data from disk through "index"
        - index is like sorting the data, this helps with searching.

We're going to look at everything except the parser

- Table === "Relational"

A database cannot fit in memory, this causes a lot of problems with traditional algorithms we've seen before. (All sorting algorithms we've seen before for example need all the data in memory).
