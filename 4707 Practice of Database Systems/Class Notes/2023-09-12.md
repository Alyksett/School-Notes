### The Entity-Relationship Model

Conceptual design: (ER Model is used at this stage)
- What are the entities and what are the retlationships?

***Entity***
- Real world object distinguishable from other objects
- An entity is described as a set of *attributes* 
***Entity set***
- A collection of similar entities, eg students
- Each entity set has a key
- Each attribute has a *domain*

| ID  | GPA | Name   | Credits | Email            |
| --- | --- | ------ | ------- | ---------------- |
| 000 | 4.0 | Austin | 15      | lykse010@umn.edu |
| 001 | 3.9 | Bob    | 14      | bob123@umn.edu   |
| 113 | 3.1 | Tom    | 12      | tom444@umn.edu   |


ID is a **KEY**. The one thing that garuntees no two entities will be the same. There may be other keys-- email for example could also be a unique key.

```mermaid
graph TD
   SSN((_SSN_)) --- Employees((Employees))
   name((name)) --- Employees((Employees))
   lot((lot)) --- Employees[[Employees]]
```

You tell the builder of the DB that SSN is unique and will be the key, builder will translate that into a table;

| SSN | Name | lot |
| --- | ---- | --- |
| ... | ...  | ... |
| ... | ...  | ... |
| ... | ...  | ... |

We can also have departments;

```mermaid
graph TD
   dID((_dID_)) --- Departments((Departments))
   dName((dName)) --- Departments((Departments))
   budget((budget)) --- Departments[[Departments]]
```

key: minimum set of attributes that can uniquely identify any entity.
* if there are more than one candidate keys, then one of them is the primary key.

* underline key in the diagram.

- Choosing the right key is important -- the key WILL order the data and that does make a difference.


- Make the choice based on the customer. For example with students, what does the Uni use more to do searches? Email or Student ID etc.

Now we create associations by RELATION
```mermaid
graph TB
   SSN((_SSN_)) --- Employees((Employees))
   name((name)) --- Employees((Employees))
   lot((lot)) --- Employees[[Employees]]

    Employees[[Employees]] --- Works((Works In))
    Works{{Works In}} --- Departments[[Departments]]
    Since((Since)) --- Works{{Works In }}

   dID((_dID_)) --- Departments((Departments))
   dName((dName)) --- Departments((Departments))
   budget((budget)) --- Departments[[Departments]]

```

---

N-ary Relationship

An n-ary relationship set R relates n entity sets E1.. En. Each relationship in R involves e1 ... en


```mermaid
graph LR
   SSN((_SSN_)) --- Employees((Employees))
   name((name)) --- Employees((Employees))
   lot((lot)) --- Employees[[Employees]]

    Works{{Works In}} --- Departments[[Departments]]
    
    Employees[[Employees]] --- Works((Works In))
    Locations((Locations)) --- Works{{Works In }}
    Since((Since)) --- Works{{Works In }}
    Locations((Locations)) --- address((address))
    Locations[[Locations]] --- capacity((capacity))


   dID((_dID_)) --- Departments((Departments))
   dName((dName)) --- Departments((Departments))
   budget((budget)) --- Departments[[Departments]]


```


The entity set in a relation may not be distinct.
- An employee can supervise another employee
- In this case, a role indicator should be lebeled (supervisor, subordinate)
- Same entity set could participare in different relationship sets, or in different 'roles' in the same set.


- *Diamond box is a relationship.*

What about in cases where a set has a single thing?
- eg a departemnt has many employeed, but at most one manager

Use an arrow

- Many-to-Many
  - Works-in: One employee may work in more than 1 depts. One department may have more than 1 employee.
- 1-to-many
  - Manages: A department is managed is only one manager, however one employee can manage more than one department
- Many-to-1
  - Works-in: If we add a constraint that each employee can work only in one department
  - It's previous is Many-to-many
- 1-1
  - Manages: If we add a constraint that one employee can only manage one department
  - It's previous is 1-to-many


Note: Abiding by this so rigidly can be annoying in the real world.

### Paritipation Constraints

- Does every departemnt have a manager?
  - If so, this is a participation constraint: the participation of departments in manages is said to be *total (vs partial)*
    - Every dID value in Departments table must appear in a row of the manages table (with a non-null SSN)
  


```mermaid
graph TD
   employee[employee] --- manager{manager}
   employee[employee] === worksin{works_in}
   
   departemnt[departments] --has one--> manager{manager}
   departemnt[departments] === worksin{works_in}
```

Bold line: Need at least one
Arrow: At most


Note here: employee -> manages is not bolded, this means that an employee doesn't have to be a manager.
