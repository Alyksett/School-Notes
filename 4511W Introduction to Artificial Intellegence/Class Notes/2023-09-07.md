Thermostat is a rational agent

Two ways to describe an agent based on what it senses;
1. Agent function = directly map what agent has sensed (and any history) to an action
2. Agent program = logic dictating next action (current and possibly past precepts can be used as an input to logic)

```
if [Dirty] return suck
loop:
    if at [room A], return [move right]
    if at [room B], return [move left]
```


|Precept|Action
|---|---
A, Dirty|Suck
A, Clean| Move right
B, Dirty|Suck
B, Clean| Move Left
...|...


Create a performance metric in terms of the environment and not the behavior of the agent
 - ie if the metric is to suck the most dirt it'll suck then drop then suck over and over again


Rational Agent depends on:
1. Performance measure
2. Knowledge of environment
3. Actions available
4. History of past actions

These four are called the _Task Environment_ (___PEAS___)
```

Environment
Actuators
Sensors

Agent Types
1. Simple reflex
    - Acts on only the most recent precept without history
    - "If cur then"
2. Model-based reflex
    - Needs to have internal state (model of environment)
    - The internal state needs to be from the agent's POV
3. Goal-based
    - More broad, it has a goal that specifies a desired outcome
4. Utility-based
    - Can map a seequence of states or actions to a value
    - Goals can be defined as `Good | Bad` and is not continuous

Thermostat: Simple, maybe Model-Based

Google Maps: Utility based.
