# FALL 2023 School Repository

This repository contains (mostly) notes for my classes, written in markdown.

There'a bash script to generate some template files for quick startup, `gen.sh`

Many notes may be incomplete, I do not know how often I will even write notes for some classes (For example 5106 will likely have no lecture notes since laptops are dis-allowed during class)
